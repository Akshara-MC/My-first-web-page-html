	<h1>College closures are necessary to prevent the spread of the covid virus</h1>
	<p><font size="3">It is felt that even after the spread of Coronavirus is contained, certain preventive measures
will be required to be followed for quite some time to avoid its recurrence. This will be all the
more necessary for educational institutions as large numbers of students gather on the
campuses. Keeping all these factors in view, the University Grants Commission has framed
Guidelines for the universities and colleges which they may follow, while reopening their
campuses after lockdown and the summer vacations. These Guidelines have been vetted by
the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs and
the Ministry of Education. The Guidelines may be adopted by the institutions as per the local
conditions and directives of the Government authorities.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Physical distancing of at least 6 feet to be followed as far as feasible.</li>
		<li>Use of face covers/masks to be made mandatory.</li>
